# 04 Coding Quiz - True or False

## Week 4 Challenge - Accepted 

---

### Introduction: 

This project is designed as a True or False coding related quiz with timer. Multiple choice require more time to evaluate answers so I simplified to allow the user to cycle through more questions. 

The instructions are posted for the user to see. Ten points for every correct answer and a deduction of ten seconds for every wrong answer.

### Highlights:

The Coding Quiz was built using jquery library in javascript. The design was created to bring attention to the question portion of the quick at the center of the page. 

The timer and Highscores buttons are located at the top left corner while the start button is closer to the questions section. 

I included a text file in the Assets folder of my whiteboarding exercise. 

The Image here represents an example of the main page design.

### Summary: 

This is a fun application for anybody learning to code. The multiple choice questions slow the user down and the minor adjustment makes it more fun.
